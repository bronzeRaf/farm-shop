# Farm shop

A Node.js sample application implementing a Farm Online Shop 😁

Uses minimum 3rd party packages, so:
- lets you test around routing
- is connected to JSON data simulating an API/DB data retrieval
- contains code (commented out) to read-write from-to files so make tests straightforward
- contains code to dynamically replace placeholder into dynamic pages (custom HTML templating)
- contains a custom module to play around importing-exporting own Node modules

## Starting the app

Assuming you have already installed Node.js, you can install dependencies and run the server using:

```
npm -i
npm start
```
